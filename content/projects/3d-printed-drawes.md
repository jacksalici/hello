My main desk where I spend several hours per day is the Ikea Table Norråker. It's a good desk, it's minimal, solid but has a little flaw: it has no drawers. Luckily there about 12 cm from the apron (the wooden panel that connects the legs and the top) to the edge of the surface, so I designed several drawers to put in that space.

If you don't have the Norråker but a similar table, chances are that these drawers are still perfect (if the differences are minimal, you can just scale all the objects with the same multiplier).


**REQUIREMENTS:**

You will need 2 wood screws (`⌀3.5mm`) for each slider. The length should be `20/25 mm`, keep in mind that one of them has to be longer because of the drawer's stopping mechanism.

**CONTENT:**

 - Standard drawer without handle
 - Standard drawer with handle
 - Right angular drawer without handle
 - Right angular drawer withs handle
 - Slider
 - Stopping piece for the slider
 - Big and small handles

You can choose to print the version with or the one without the handle, according to your preference and the ability of your printer (see How To Print).

> _For my Ikea Table Norråker, 4 standard drawers and 2 angular drawers fit perfectly on the length of the apron. In this case, you'll need also 7 slider and 5 stopping parts. For the left angular drawers, you can just mirror the object along the X-axis._

**HOW TO PRINT:**

This depends on your printer. I've printed all the drawers upside down so that the handle can be printed perfectly and the bottom of the drawers has no sticking problem with the hotbed (because of the humidity large surfaces could create some bubbles). However, this position needs a lot of supports, so I don't like it much due to the waste of filament. If you don't have any problems with printings, I recommend you to print all the drawers normally and without the handles. You can still print that separately and then glue it to the bottom of the drawers. It's up to you. 
Moreover, I suggest you print with a very low resolution `(.28mm)`, and a high fill density `(60/100%)`. The parts to fill are a few, so this should change very little the amount of plastic need, but at the same time, it increases the strength of the pieces. Remember also to opt-in the option "Print tiny walls", if your slicer has that.

**ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS:**

After having printed all the necessary parts, you have to measure where to screw in the sliders. This part is very hard because you have to assure that drawers can slide smoothly but they shouldn't keep much backlash. At this point, set in place the shorter screw in the middle hole of each slider, and also the second one in the front hole of the sliders that will sustain the lateral drawers. Then, insert all the drawers and, using a long screwdriver, screw in the remaining screws in the front holes of the central sliders, remembering to screw also the stopping pieces under each slider (the last image should help you to understand). The third hole can remain without a screw.
