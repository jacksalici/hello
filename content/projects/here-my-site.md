After several years of using Wordpress, I decided to create a static site. I make this choice because a state site is more seo optimized, lighter and more customizable. I used the Hugo Framework and Codex theme as a starting point and then I started customizing the whole site by adding some cool stuff.

In the homepage I used the faboulus Typed.js plugin by Matt Boldt and the Hugo Easy Gallery by Li-Wen Yip, both relased under Mit Licence. Then I gonna add the dark version and other javascript things.

I will release the new theme under Mit Licence on Github.
